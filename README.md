## Welcome

### I am a lecturer at the department of people, work, and employment at Leeds University Business School. \\
### Prior to that, I worked as a researcher with an ESRC-funded project "Young Women's Working Lives" hosted at City University of London and University of Leeds. 
### I am interested in dynamics between social networks and wellbeing, between work and family, and between gender and age on the labour market.\\
