## Welcome

### I am a lecturer at the [department of people, work, and employment](https://business.leeds.ac.uk/departments-people-work-employment) at Leeds University Business School.
### Prior to that, I worked as a researcher with an ESRC-funded project ["Young Women's Working Lives"](https://ywworking.co.uk/) hosted at City University of London and University of Leeds. 
### I am interested in dynamics between social networks and wellbeing, between work and family, and between gender and age on the labour market. I received my Ph.D. in the [joint program of sociology and demography](https://grad.berkeley.edu/program/sociology-demography/) from UC Berkeley.
